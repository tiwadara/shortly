### Deliverables
    Task was clear and resource were beautifully provided and documented. I'll highlight a few of the
    APIs I used and their reasons. We can have more conversations as you'd like.

    ##  ðŸš€ Room API - For data persistence
    I prefer to setup a database in projects beacause,
    1. They will get larger and you'd need to able to make quick CRUD actions
    2. I chose room cause of it abstractions, and I could make reactive connections to it

    ## ðŸš€  Flow API - For reactive programming
    I chose Flow because it helps me make reactive calls without having to be on the UI thread
    or hold a reference to it. I however converted to LiveData on the UI beacause it's lifecycle aware

    ## ðŸš€  Multi-Module
    I have made it a habit to start project with a modular architecture, makes it easier to collaborate,
    extend and could shorten test time when the project gets larger

    ## ðŸš€  MVI ( Having UI states and Events )
   The model and the View are a given , the interesting parts are the Intents ( States and Events)
    It makes it easy for me to manage the UI state, as there will all ways be a state for the UI. It
    could be a loading state, a failed state, or any other state I define. This makes it easy to track errors,
    replay states,
    This way , all the UI does it respond to states, that come from just one single class and no other.
    Makes it easier to test , as I know how many states I expect a successful request to trigger.
    Give great control over the UI. It's quite similar to the BLOc pattern popular in Flutter
